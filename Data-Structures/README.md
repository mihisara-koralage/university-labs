# Data Structures and Algorithms Practicals

This folder contains practical exercises and projects related to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) completed during my undergraduate studies in Software Engineering.

## Topics Covered
- Stack implementation using arrays
- Queue implementation
- Linked lists (singly, doubly)
- Sorting algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion)
- Searching algorithms (Linear, Binary)
- Other classic DSA problems

## Purpose
- Practice and reinforce understanding of fundamental DSA concepts
- Implement algorithms in Java and understand their logic
- Build a portfolio of working code examples

## How to Use
- Each practical is organized in its own folder with proper Java files
- Run each Java program independently
- Each folder may include a `README.md` explaining the specific practical
