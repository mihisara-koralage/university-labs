# Decimal to Binary Conversion Using Stack

This practical demonstrates converting a decimal number to binary using a stack implemented with an array in Java.

## Features
- Stack implementation using arrays
- Push operation to store remainders
- Display method to print binary number
- Handles stack overflow

## How it works
1. The user inputs the stack size and a decimal number.
2. The program pushes the remainders (n % 2) into the stack.
3. The stack is then displayed to show the binary equivalent.

## What I Learned
- Array-based stack implementation
- Using stack to reverse sequences
- Handling stack overflow
